# ASCII Art Generator (Python)

Hi 👋  
This is a small Python project where I experimented with converting **ASCII / text art** into executable Python code.  
Instead of using arrays or external libraries, the entire design is rendered using simple `row` and `column` based logic.

The main goal of this project was to understand **how patterns, images, and text art can be represented purely using programming logic**.

---

## Why I Built This

I wanted to explore:
- How complex text art can be broken into coordinates
- How Python conditionals can recreate visual patterns
- How logic alone can generate creative console output

This project helped me improve my **logical thinking, patience, and attention to detail**.

## What This Project Does

- Prints detailed ASCII art directly in the terminal
- Uses different characters like `#`, `*`, `%`, `@`, `+` to create visual depth
- Demonstrates how every character is placed using `(row, col)` conditions
- Runs without any external dependencies

---

## Tech Used

- **Language:** Python  
- **Concepts:**  
  - Conditional statements  
  - Pattern programming  
  - Console output formatting

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
